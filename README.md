# Familial aggregation of seizure outcomes in four familial epilepsy cohorts

To assess if binary epilepsy outcomes (remission, number of seizures, treatment response) are significantly aggregated in families, we modeled between-family variation using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) framework, with age, age of epilepsy onset, and epitype as the fixed effects and family-specific random intercepts.
